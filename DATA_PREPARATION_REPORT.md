## 📝 SAMPLE EXAMPLES

### High-Quality Cleaned Sample
```gherkin
Input: Create a positive test case for fund transfer with High priority

Output:
Scenario: Successfully perform Fund Transfer
  Given the user is logged into mobile banking
  And user has sufficient privileges
  When the user submits valid fund transfer request
  Then transaction is processed successfully
  And notification is sent to user
```

### Augmented Sample
```gherkin
Input: Test case for security settings: security scenario, Priority: Critical

Output:
Scenario: Verify Security Settings security controls
  Given the user has authenticated successfully
  When the user attempts action and OTP verification is triggered
  Then security alert is triggered
  And attempt is logged for review
```
